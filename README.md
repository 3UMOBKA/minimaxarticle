# minimaxarticle

this repo is dedicated to writing a medium article about the minimax algorithm for the freecodecamp community

##Intro

If you have stuglled with implementing an AI for your tic tac toe game, this read is for you.
but Rather than focusing on the user interface and the entirety of the game logic, let us dedicate this article to the minimax algorithm itself. this article will showcase a simple minimax algorithm implimentation in javascript that once given the tic tac toe board can tell you which move will result in the best outcome.

the 0 sum game

what is minimax

we are not making a tic tac toe rather focusing on the AI merely

## the explain

check all possible states

how many states are initially there

move down the tree to show an example


## the code
helper functions

what the function will get and what will it output


## conclusion
